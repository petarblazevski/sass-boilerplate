# Sass Boilerplate

This is a modified version from [Hugo Giraudel Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) for my personal use.

It uses [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) for writing convetions.
